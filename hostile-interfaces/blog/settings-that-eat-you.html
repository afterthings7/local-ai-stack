            <h1>Settings That Eat You</h1>
            <div class="subtitle">A Meditation on Toggle Switches</div>

            <p>Your goal is simple: enable dark mode. The settings panel is right there. Dark mode is one of the options. This should take approximately three seconds.</p>
            <p>It will not take three seconds.</p>

            <h2>The Setup</h2>
            <p>A typical settings panel. Toggles for notifications, privacy options, accessibility features, appearance preferences. All the things you'd expect. The dark mode toggle is clearly labeled. You can see it.</p>
            <p>The problem is that some toggles affect other toggles. Some labels mean the opposite of what they say. Some options are hidden until you enable something else. And at least one toggle, when flipped, will reset your progress entirely.</p>

            <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Modern settings panels are an exercise in unintended consequences. Turn on one feature, break another. Enable privacy mode, lose functionality you didn't know you wanted. It's not malicious design—it's just complexity accumulating faster than anyone can document.</p>
            <p>Settings That Eat You makes this explicit. The interdependencies are the game. Understanding how one toggle affects another is the puzzle. The fact that you just want dark mode and are now twenty minutes deep in accessibility settings is the experience.</p>

            <h2>Common Traps</h2>
            <p>The "Enhanced Mode" toggle sounds helpful. It is not helpful.</p>
            <p>The privacy section appears unrelated to appearance. It is not unrelated.</p>
            <p>The reset button will be clicked by accident exactly once. You will not click it by accident twice.</p>

            <h2>Victory Condition</h2>
            <p>When you successfully enable dark mode and save your changes, you win. The irony is that you'll then be looking at the victory screen in dark mode, wondering if the light mode version looked better.</p>
            <p>There's probably a lesson here about wanting things versus having them. But mostly it's about toggle switches.</p>
