            <h1>Phone Support</h1>
            <div class="subtitle">A Love Letter to Everyone Who's Ever Spelled Their Email Out Loud</div>

            <p>There's a special kind of despair that only people with unusual email addresses understand. It's 2024 and you're still spelling out "underscore" to a customer service rep who clearly has better places to be.</p>

            <h2>The Inspiration</h2>
            <p>This game exists because of a McSweeney's article that catalogued email addresses specifically designed to be impossible to dictate over the phone. Addresses like <code>MikeAtYahooDotCom@hotmail.com</code> and <code>AAAAAThatsSixAs@yahoo.com</code>. The article is comedy. The fact that these emails would actually work is tragedy.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>You're on a call with a support agent. They need to verify your email address. Simple enough—except the agent uses a phonetic alphabet that would make NATO cry. "A as in Aisle. P as in Pterodactyl. K as in Knight."</p>
            <p>When you make mistakes, the agent gets annoyed. When the agent gets annoyed, they talk faster. When they talk faster, you make more mistakes. It's a beautiful feedback loop of mutual frustration.</p>

            <h2>The Uncomfortable Truth</h2>
            <p>The worst part isn't the game itself. The worst part is how familiar it feels. You've been here before. You've spelled your email to someone who genuinely did not want to write it down. You've said "no, that's B as in boy" and heard the pause that means they already typed D.</p>
            <p>This isn't satire. It's documentary.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Survival</h2>
            <p>Listen carefully on the first pass. The speed only goes up from there. Also, maybe consider simplifying your email address. Or accept that some subscriptions simply aren't worth verifying.</p>
