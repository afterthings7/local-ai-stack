            <h1>Dissolving CAPTCHA</h1>
            <div class="subtitle">Proof of Humanity, Subject to Availability</div>

            <p>CAPTCHAs exist to prove you're human. The Dissolving CAPTCHA adds a caveat: prove you're human, quickly, before the evidence disappears.</p>

            <h2>The Problem with Regular CAPTCHAs</h2>
            <p>Traditional CAPTCHAs give you distorted text and unlimited time to squint at it. Some even have audio alternatives. They're practically accommodating. This felt like an oversight.</p>

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>In Dissolving CAPTCHA, the text you need to type starts clear but immediately begins to decay. Characters fade. Letters scramble into their confusable cousins—O becomes 0, I becomes 1, and for one chaotic moment you're not sure if that's an S or a 5.</p>
            <p>By level three, the characters are glitching. By level five, they're dissolving into abstract expressionism before your eyes.</p>

            <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
            <p>There's something honest about a verification system that degrades over time. Real-world verification works the same way. Your passport expires. Your ID fades. Your certainty about whether you locked the door decreases with distance from the house.</p>
            <p>The Dissolving CAPTCHA simply accelerates this natural entropy. It asks: can you prove you're human right now? Not in thirty seconds. Now.</p>

            <h2>How to Win</h2>
            <p>Type fast. Trust your first instinct. And maybe lower your expectations about what "proving humanity" should feel like. Because honestly, if an AI can solve this, they've earned it.</p>
