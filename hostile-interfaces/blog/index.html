            <p class="subtitle">A Love Letter to Everyone Who's Ever Spelled Their Email Out Loud</p>
            <p>This game exists because of a McSweeney's article that catalogued email addresses specifically designed to be impossible to dictate over the phone. Addresses like MikeAtYahooDotCom@hotmail.com. The article is comedy. The fact that these emails would actually work is tragedy.</p>

            <p>Every dark pattern guide warns about "confirm-shaming." But what if the dialog took a different approach? What if it was physically impossible to confirm? The button doesn't want you to commit. The button has seen other users click things they regret.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Proof of Humanity, Subject to Availability</p>
            <p>Traditional CAPTCHAs give you distorted text and unlimited time to squint at it. This felt like an oversight. In Dissolving CAPTCHA, the text you need to type starts clear but immediately begins to decay. Characters fade. Letters scramble into their confusable cousins.</p>
