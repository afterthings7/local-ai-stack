            <h1>Password Invaders</h1>
            <div class="subtitle">Where Space Invaders Meets Security Theater</div>

            <p>What if creating a password was a real-time action game? What if the characters you needed fell from the sky and you had to shoot them before they crushed you? What if password requirements weren't just annoying, but also trying to kill you?</p>
            <p>Welcome to Password Invaders.</p>

            <h2>The Premise</h2>
            <p>Characters fall from the top of the screen. You pilot a ship at the bottom. Shooting a character adds it to your password. Your password must meet requirements that appear on screen. The requirements update as your password grows.</p>
            <p>Miss too many characters and they pile up at the bottom. When the pile reaches your ship, you die. Also, you still haven't created a valid password.</p>

            <h2>Why This Works</h2>
            <p>Password creation is already stressful. It's a puzzle where the rules reveal themselves through rejection. "Must contain a special character." Okay. "Cannot contain your username." Wait, what? "Must not be similar to your previous 12 passwords." How would I even know?</p>
            <p>Password Invaders takes this stress and makes it kinetic. Now you're not just thinking about password rules—you're dodging them. The uppercase letter you need is descending alongside numbers you don't want. Shoot carefully.</p>

            <h2>The Requirements</h2>
            <p>They escalate. First you need length. Then uppercase. Then special characters. Then the system decides you can't have consecutive repeated characters. The requirements compound like interest on a bad loan.</p>

            <h2>Life Lessons</h2>
            <p>Sometimes in life, all the pieces you need are falling toward you at once. The secret is knowing which ones to shoot and which to let pass. This applies to passwords, to emails, and to most meetings.</p>
            <p>Also, maybe use a password manager.</p>
